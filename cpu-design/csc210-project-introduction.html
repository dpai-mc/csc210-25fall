            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">Aloha, and welcome to the <strong>8-bit CPU Simulation project</strong>—the culminating experience for this course. In this video, you'll receive a comprehensive overview and introduction to the final project. We'll explore what components you need to build, how the project is structured, and what grade categories (A, B, or C) require. You'll learn about the essential circuits, including the RAM summary, ALU summary, and additional required components such as registers, temporary storage, and the program counter. We'll walk through the control unit architecture, individual instruction cycles, and how to assemble everything into a fully functional 8-bit CPU simulator. Whether you're aiming for a basic implementation or a complete system, this video will guide you through the entire scope of the project.</p>

00:00.640 --> 00:06.160
Aloha! So in this video I just want to give you a brief overview and introduction to the

00:06.160 --> 00:14.720
final project. And so when you go and look at the final project it's going to show up as an

00:14.720 --> 00:22.160
assignment for the 8-bit CPU. You need to include all your circuits in your single file. Don't link

00:22.160 --> 00:29.760
them. Everything needs to be in the one file. It's created from basic gates except in the very

00:29.760 --> 00:35.760
very very final part for the top level sim there's a couple things for the external we're learning

00:35.760 --> 00:40.240
from external ram and stuff where we'll use some pre-built stuff. But other than that everything

00:40.240 --> 00:45.520
needs to be built by you by you using basically AND gates, NAND gates, OR gates, NOR gates,

00:45.520 --> 00:52.000
that kind of thing. Okay so this is just a brief kind of a top level summary of what

00:52.000 --> 00:52.120
I'll be doing in the final project. So I'm going to go ahead and show you what I'm going to do.

00:52.120 --> 00:52.140
Okay so this is just a brief kind of a top level summary of what I'll be doing in the final project.

00:52.140 --> 00:54.440
So I'm going to go ahead and show you what I'm going to do. Our final CPU is going to look like.

00:55.120 --> 00:59.200
You know we have this ring this rectangle around the outside that's our bus.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.320
We have our RAM. We have our MAR from our memory address register. But this is basically

01:07.000 --> 01:14.960
um setting the address that we're from that we're using from RAM. We have a control unit that does

01:14.960 --> 01:22.100
all the stuff. We have four basic registers. You can label them R1 to R4 or I read I've labeled them

01:22.100 --> 01:31.880
mine R0 to R3. You have a TMP a temp. The bus one into your ALU B side. Your A side will be

01:31.880 --> 01:39.400
directly connected to the bus. Your ALU will have the three op codes A, B, and C that come from the

01:39.400 --> 01:47.280
control unit. We have an accumulator. We have a clock. We have some flags. And some of this there's

01:47.280 --> 01:51.400
a just some a few other things that we're going to add. But this is just kind of a general overview

01:51.400 --> 01:51.940
of the major part of the project. So I'm going to go ahead and show you what I'm going to do.

01:51.940 --> 01:52.080
So I'm going to go ahead and show you what I'm going to do. I'm going to go ahead and show you

01:52.100 --> 01:52.340
what I'm going to do. I'm going to go ahead and show you what I'm going to do. I'm going to go ahead

01:52.340 --> 01:54.240
and show you what I'm going to do. I'm going to go ahead and show you what I'm going to do.

01:54.240 --> 01:57.340
Okay so for the final

02:00.080 --> 02:08.480
project I've broken it into three grade categories A, B, or C. Obviously if you don't do C then you're

02:08.480 --> 02:14.400
going to get something less than C. The biggest thing where you need to start is the circuits

02:14.400 --> 02:19.680
needed for final project. Okay and so you can click on that and it'll open it up in that same

02:21.160 --> 02:21.740
assignment.

02:22.100 --> 02:33.720
Or what you might want to do, which might make it easier, is if you right click and open in the new tab, it will open it up on my GitHub page.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.720
OK, so then it's just that there's nothing else.

02:37.820 --> 02:40.600
There's no canvas surrounding it.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.900
Either way, it works fine.

02:43.900 --> 02:48.180
I like to do it this way, so I'd always have this one back here as my reference.

02:48.180 --> 03:01.780
But. So basically, all this stuff on the top before the core, this RAM circuits required and basic memory building block, these are all part of the RAM summary.

03:03.580 --> 03:12.260
OK, one bit, a bit register, building your decoder and then putting it all together to the addressable RAM byte.

03:14.340 --> 03:16.460
OK, did you create?

03:18.180 --> 03:24.320
OK, so that's all these.

03:27.060 --> 03:37.320
You know, part of RAM summary, all these this one memory, one bit memory circuits, also part of the RAM summary, and we also have the ALU summary, which you should have already walked through and created.

03:38.700 --> 03:43.160
All these shift left, shift right, add to not and or Zor.

03:45.840 --> 03:47.000
OK, but it's all here again.

03:48.180 --> 03:52.120
And then here's the first new thing is additional circuits required.

03:53.060 --> 04:10.700
OK, so when we do this, we have our ALU, we have our RAM, but now we need our registers, we need temp, TMP, we need bus one, we need our clock, we need our accumulator, and then we also need our program counter and our instruction register.

04:11.560 --> 04:15.060
Now, here's the key, these register based components.

04:16.660 --> 04:17.940
CPU are for me.

04:17.940 --> 04:21.860
Is CPU RAM, so that's these are one to our four circuits.

04:22.820 --> 04:28.600
OK, so all this is, is a regular register, so you take a register, you copy it.

04:29.640 --> 04:35.260
Create a new circuit called whatever you want to call it, CPU, RAM is a good name for it.

04:36.320 --> 04:44.780
OK, and then all you do is you copy the register circuit, paste it in that new circuit, and then you just change the drawing.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.940
OK, our registers when we build.

04:48.140 --> 04:51.940
Then before the input was on the left and output was on the right.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.300
OK, and we need those.

04:55.160 --> 04:56.700
Because those work in our RAM byte.

04:57.760 --> 05:01.760
What we want here is we want to register where input and output are on the top.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.760
Set an enabler on the bottom.

05:05.720 --> 05:09.620
And then I have that central, you know, what's stored in here off the middle here, but.

05:10.740 --> 05:17.720
So basically, all you're doing is you're going to copy that register into a new circuit and then do the circuit appearance and draw it like this.

05:17.940 --> 05:30.060
OK, accumulator is exactly the same thing, it's another register, OK, except for now, we want the input on the top and the output on the bottom.

05:32.640 --> 05:33.140
OK.

05:34.940 --> 05:37.640
And we want to set and enable on the right side.

05:39.840 --> 05:40.840
It's the same thing.

05:42.340 --> 05:45.760
Copy that register circuit, all the things in the register circuit.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.920
Paste it into a new circuit.

05:48.240 --> 05:49.380
Call the accumulator.

05:50.300 --> 05:52.060
And then change the circuit appearance.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.700
OK, program counter again, 8-bit register.

05:57.520 --> 06:05.780
But this one, instead of having input and output on the top, you want input and output on the bottom and set and enable on the top.

06:07.220 --> 06:12.280
OK, and this is just so that when we put it into our full up CPU, it's just easier to do.

06:12.680 --> 06:13.840
The wiring is easier.

06:13.980 --> 06:15.220
It's straight line wiring.

06:16.440 --> 06:17.920
OK, now memory.

06:18.060 --> 06:40.060
Memory-based circuits, TMP is a memory-based circuit, so we need an 8-bit memory, build it on 8-bit memory, OK, so you drop in an 8-bit memory circuit, and then we take input through a controlled buffer off a set, so that's how we're controlling how it gets in, is through this set bit, and then we have an output.

06:40.060 --> 06:44.960
OK, we redraw input on the top, output on the bottom, sets on the right.

06:44.960 --> 06:54.240
The instruction register is another 8-bit memory circuit, OK, where input's on the bottom, output's on the top, and sets on the right side.

06:57.140 --> 07:01.220
All right, our bus 1 circuit, so now I have the bus 1 details here.

07:03.580 --> 07:09.160
We start with 8-bit input, 8-bit output, and we have a bus 1 input on the right.

07:09.160 --> 07:14.660
And all what happens, how it works, is the zero.

07:14.960 --> 07:21.080
Rightmost bit from the input side ores with this 1-bit from bus 1.

07:22.080 --> 07:27.300
OK, and the output of that ore goes to the zero output, zero bit on the output side.

07:28.300 --> 07:34.640
And then all the rest go into two input AND gates.

07:36.020 --> 07:40.660
OK, and the second input is the knotted bus 1.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.440
OK, so when bus 1 is 1.

07:45.920 --> 07:50.040
All these are coming in as zero, so these ANDs will always be zero.

07:51.040 --> 07:53.120
So when bus 1 is 1, you only get 1.

07:55.100 --> 08:01.320
OK, we do that so that we can add 1 to the memory location.

08:01.500 --> 08:05.420
And so for the next cycle, we increment the program counter.

08:06.580 --> 08:13.060
OK, and then finally we have a clock. The clock is a 1-bit external input. When you run your project, you're going to click clock and it will go true and false.

08:14.060 --> 08:14.460
OK.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.840
So that brings me to control circuits.

08:19.860 --> 08:26.240
And so we're basically going to be building control circuits for each instruction cycle that we implement.

08:27.800 --> 08:31.360
OK, so think about, you know, like an add instruction.

08:31.940 --> 08:34.420
What does it do? It adds two numbers.

08:35.660 --> 08:42.380
What you end up doing is for like add two numbers, you're going to build a control logic diagram or a control circuit that all it will do is add two numbers and won't do anything else.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.560
OK, so you want to call it something specific control ad or, you know.

08:45.200 --> 08:45.600
OK.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.080
And then you're going to.

08:48.280 --> 08:51.820
You put that into a CPU because you're going to have a control unit.

08:51.980 --> 08:53.340
You're going to stick that into the CPU.

08:55.220 --> 08:58.960
OK, and there's some things you want to do so that you can then.

08:59.920 --> 09:06.300
Hard code some values into these two registers and have it write the result into this register.

09:07.480 --> 09:11.080
OK, so you're just going to hard code it so it only does one thing.

09:11.940 --> 09:15.240
And that's to add two numbers together that you set manually.

09:16.640 --> 09:17.040
OK.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.240
And the purpose behind doing.

09:18.360 --> 09:21.120
These this way is so that you get an idea of how.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.440
Each cycle works.

09:24.740 --> 09:25.320
All right.

09:27.640 --> 09:32.980
There are like I said, there's nine of these different cycles, but you don't have to do all nine of them.

09:34.600 --> 09:35.000
OK.

09:37.240 --> 09:40.600
What you have to do is you have to do at least four.

09:41.240 --> 09:42.940
So the minimum you do is well.

09:43.940 --> 09:45.320
For C, you can do four.

09:46.620 --> 09:47.800
And they can stop there.

09:48.040 --> 09:48.260
I did.

09:48.360 --> 09:48.900
Those four.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.360
I don't have to finish anything else.

09:51.740 --> 09:54.840
OK, for a B, you only have to do two of them.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.200
One of them instructions and one of jump instructions.

09:59.220 --> 10:02.300
OK, so when you look at these, sorry.

10:04.300 --> 10:10.320
There are instruction cycles, five of them in four of these jump instruction cycles.

10:10.900 --> 10:15.740
OK, so for a C, you got to do two of these and two of these.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.180
For a B, you have to do one.

10:18.180 --> 10:19.960
And one of these and one of these.

10:21.780 --> 10:23.880
OK, and then also the final control unit.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.380
OK, so.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.120
If you do this thing.

10:33.960 --> 10:34.200
OK.

10:36.840 --> 10:40.580
This ugly thing, and I'll have a separate video about this ugly thing.

10:41.480 --> 10:42.880
About how I suggest you should make it.

10:44.340 --> 10:45.360
But right now we have this.

10:45.360 --> 10:46.500
This is the total view.

10:47.180 --> 10:52.460
And then we have this is the total view, and then we have the top view.

10:54.060 --> 10:54.680
This is a.

10:56.720 --> 10:57.920
Image of the top view.

10:58.820 --> 11:00.440
You can download this image if you want.

11:01.940 --> 11:03.300
And then there's also a bottom view.

11:06.460 --> 11:09.860
OK, so the top half and bottom half are split here so that you have a little bit better.

11:10.560 --> 11:14.600
You can see where lines cross and where there's junctioned when they cross that kind of thing.

11:16.000 --> 11:16.940
OK, but like I said, there's.

11:16.940 --> 11:18.820
There'll be a separate video just about this one.

11:23.060 --> 11:31.340
Right, so your final control unit, and then you got to build your final CPU, which is here's your final control unit, and there's a bunch of other stuff in here.

11:32.500 --> 11:36.500
OK, and here's the circles for all these bunch of other things that we're sticking in.

11:37.740 --> 11:43.940
I labeled them one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight and nine.

11:45.820 --> 11:46.820
Right.

11:46.940 --> 11:50.820
And then down here, all these talk about those nine things.

11:55.300 --> 11:56.580
I don't know if they're connected yet.

11:56.740 --> 11:57.820
Now I got to finish these.

11:57.860 --> 11:59.700
They're not connected yet, but they will get there.

12:02.060 --> 12:08.620
OK, but then when you do this final CPU, you can have to do these nine additional kind of modifications.

12:10.300 --> 12:13.260
All right, and each one will explain what it is and how it works.

12:13.260 --> 12:27.620
And then for the last one, for an A, then you have to take your final CPU, and then you're going to have to create a new circuit.

12:27.620 --> 12:36.300
OK, this is a new circuit, and so your final CPU, you need to redraw it to look like this.

12:38.300 --> 12:41.040
OK, so we build all these things.

12:43.260 --> 12:51.540
This is the top level circuit appearance.

12:51.540 --> 12:56.460
You're going to build the CPU circuit appearance, but a tunnel.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.500
These are tunnels.

12:58.220 --> 13:04.580
And a tunnel is just like a tag that and I'll talk about it in the control, the detail control unit.

13:05.100 --> 13:12.580
But it's just a tag that basically is like a wireless connection to the tag matching tag with the exact same name in it.

13:12.580 --> 13:12.660
OK.

13:13.260 --> 13:17.500
And then decide to do the displays.

13:19.180 --> 13:25.340
OK, to create these displays and we do the display so that when you run your program.

13:26.980 --> 13:39.380
You can watch all these things, the bus, what's on the bus, what's in the accumulator, what's in the program counter, what's in the instruction register and what's in these four registers and in-game point time, you'll see them, they'll light up and they'll keep changing as you do stuff.

13:39.380 --> 13:54.780
OK, load, set, load, reset about what those are clock setting, how to do the clock setting, but those are external RAM to load our program.

13:55.780 --> 13:58.300
This is how we load our program, external RAM.

13:58.300 --> 14:06.620
And I also have a video that walks through running a program and making it work and seeing how watching the results come out.

14:08.260 --> 14:08.420
Right.

14:08.420 --> 14:09.300
So that's kind of the overview.

14:09.300 --> 14:12.820
Of the semester project.

14:15.860 --> 14:23.040
Now, you run into problems or issues, let me know if you have a image that doesn't make sense or you can't see it.

14:23.100 --> 14:24.100
Well, let me know.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.300
I'll try to make a new one and update it.

14:28.900 --> 14:32.120
Or if you really get stuck, make sure you make an appointment on my calendar.

14:33.120 --> 14:37.680
Be happy to meet with you and walk through and take as long, whatever time we need to.

14:39.300 --> 14:43.240
Get you on track and make sure you understand what we're doing, how it's working.

14:45.560 --> 14:45.880
OK.

14:48.660 --> 14:49.120
Good luck.

14:49.460 --> 14:50.020
Talk to you soon.`;
