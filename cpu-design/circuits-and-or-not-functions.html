    <h1> Circuits: AND, OR, NOT Functions</h1>
    <p>These circuits are essentially just extensions of the individual Gates. An AND gate, for instance, takes 2 bits and ANDs them together. For these functions, we need to do the same but instead of use two 1-bit inputs, we now have two 8-bit inputs that we are AND/OR/NOT the two together.</p>
<p>For example, for an 8-bit AND function, where you have two 8-bit inputs designated as "a" and "b", you would:</p>
<ul>
    <li>AND the position 0 bits of both together and place the result on the 0 bit position output</li>
    <li>AND the position 1bits of both together and place the result on the 1 bit position output</li>
    <li>etc ... for bits 2 through 7</li>
</ul>
<p>The same process would be done for both the OR function and the NOT function except that the NOT function only has one 8-bit input where you NOT each individual bit as it passes through to the 8-bit output.</p>
<p>As always, you need to edit your circuit appearance so that it is usable at higher levels (for use in the ALU)</p>
