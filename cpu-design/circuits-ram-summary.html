                <p>Once you have built and verified the **16x8 RAM**, you use it as a component (or subcircuit) to build the full **256x8 RAM** unit required for the CPU. A possible circuit appearance for the 16x8 RAM component is shown below:</p>
                <div class="flex justify-center my-6">

                </div>
                
                <p>To address all 256 bytes (2<sup>8</sup>), the full RAM requires an **8-bit address input**. For building my RAM, I use two **4x16 Decoders** as selection devices to pick individual bytes of RAM. The 8-bit address is split, using 4 bits for each decoder to select a row and column of 16x16 16x8 RAM blocks.</p>
                
                <p>The image below shows a conceptual layout of the 256x8 RAM matrix utilizing the 4x16 decoders for addressing:</p>

                            <p>Aloha, so in this video I just really wanted to go over a little bit of how this **RAM** works. So I built up just a little **2x2 RAM module**. You can see my each byte, so I have a vertical and horizontal input output, set, enable, reset, and then on each one I added a little output pin that I tied to memory so that I can view what's in it. Okay, now the other things that I had to add: I have two decoders, one here for the horizontal so each line is a different row of my 16x16 matrix, and then up top here for the column, so each column, so I have 16 columns, gets one of the address inputs.</p>
                            <p>I have an address input of eight bits. Four bits are going to the horizontal decoder and four bits are going to the vertical decoder. The outputs of the horizontal decoder are going to go into the set and the outputs of the vertical decoder are going to go into the enable. So, only when the horizontal and vertical are high (which only happens on one line of each) will the enable and set on that specific byte be active.</p>
                            <p>We take the set and enable and we put them into an **AND gate**, and then we take the output of the AND gate into the set on the byte and the output of the AND gate into the enable on the byte. Okay, so when the set for this decoder and the enable for this decoder are both on, that specific byte is on, and that specific byte is the one that's connected to the input and output bus. The other thing that I need to add is a **Memory Address Register (MAR)**. Okay, so I'm going to take all eight bits, four to the horizontal and four to the vertical, and I'm going to take the clock in there, and I'm going to take my input for the address and tie it to the clock.</p>
                            <p>So when the clock goes high, that address is going to be loaded into my decoder, which will be loaded into my 16x16 matrix. Okay, so hopefully that is helpful. And then I'll throw up a diagram a little bit later of how I envisioned RAM to be. Because you've got to set it up to have, you know, this memory address. So you have to have an address, set address for memory. Then you're going to have a set, enable, reset, input, and output pins. When you redraw this, you know, when you go to edit circuit appearance, you're going to redraw this and move it around and fix it so that it looks good and you can use it at the next level.</p>
