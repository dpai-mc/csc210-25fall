                <p>A S-R Latch (Set-Reset) is a simple and common way to store bits in volatile memory. The basic design is usually shown using 2-NOR gates as depicted here:</p>
                <figure class="my-6">
                    <img src="https://mendocino.instructure.com/courses/19705/files/2431564/download" alt="Circuit diagram of a Simple S-R Latch using two NOR gates." class="max-w-full h-auto rounded shadow-lg mx-auto" loading="lazy" />
                    <figcaption class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2 text-center">SR Latch using NOR gates.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>If we look at "Q" as the output or stored bit, then it is SET to 1, when S=1 and R=0. After setting, S is set to 0 and R is still 0 which "HOLDS" the value of 1 in Memory (In this application, Q is what is stored and Q' is of no interest to us except in understanding what the circuit is doing).</p>
                <p>To Reset, with S=0, we set R = 1. This sets our output Q to 0. After setting to 0, S and R are set to 0 which "HOLDS" the value of 1 in Memory.</p>

                <p>You can also replace the 2 NOR gates with 2 NAND gates and you will get circuit that does the same job. One of the best places to review this is by reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)#Simple_set-reset_latches" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia page on flip-flops</a> (this type of circuit is a flip-flop), paying special attention to the "Simple set-reset latches" portion.</p>
                <p>This is an alternative view of an <a href="http://electronics-course.com/sr-nand-latch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S-R Latch using NAND Gates</a>. You should build both the NOR and NAND versions of this in our circuit simulation software to test our how both work to store a bit.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">The Gated S-R Latch</h2>
                <p>For our CPU Design project, we want to use a **"Gated S-R Latch"** as shown here:</p>
                <figure class="my-6">
                    <img src="https://mendocino.instructure.com/courses/19705/files/2431575/download" alt="Circuit diagram of a Gated S-R Latch using four NAND gates." class="max-w-full h-auto rounded shadow-lg mx-auto" loading="lazy" />
                    <figcaption class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2 text-center">Gated S-R Latch.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>For the Gated latch, since we need to use NAND gates in front of the S-R Latch, it becomes easier to implement the S-R Latch as NAND gates instead of NOR gates, hence, we will use a circuit comprised of 4 NAND gates to store a bit in memory. This Gated S-R Latch is much easier to operate. Basically, when enable, **e**, is set to 0, the bit stored in Q is held at its value. So, when enable is 0, Q remains the same no matter what S does. When **e** is set to 1, then Q is set/takes the value of whatever S is at that moment in time.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 italic">To store a bit, you do the following:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                    <li>Set S to the value you want to store</li>
                    <li>Set e to 1</li>
                    <li>Return e to 0, Value in Q is now fixed and held in Q until the next time e is set to 1.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">The Final 1-bit Memory Circuit</h2>
                <p>As mentioned in the learning platform, we can rename our inputs and remove the Q' output since we don't use it. Our revised 1-bit NAND S-R latch, is simplified with our 2 inputs and a single output bit. There are also some settings you should set for the input pins. These are to make sure the bit is only a 2 state bit and that the behavior is "pull down" (see video in the <a title="Week 4 Learning Platform: Sequential Logic and Memory" href="https://mendocino.instructure.com/courses/19705/pages/week-4-learning-platform-sequential-logic-and-memory" data-course-type="wikiPages" data-published="false" data-api-endpoint="https://mendocino.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/19705/pages/week-4-learning-platform-sequential-logic-and-memory" data-api-returntype="Page">Week 4 Learning Platform: Sequential Logic and Memory</a> Learning Platform for this discussion).</p>
