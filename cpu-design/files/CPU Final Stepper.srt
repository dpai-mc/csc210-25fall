1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,960
Aloha so here's our completed stepper circuit you'll see we've made some changes some of the

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:21,960
changes we made we have an input called reset okay and the reset goes into this or we have a clock

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:29,360
and what we're doing with the clock we're taking into an or so we have two ores for input we're

4
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,520
going to take clock and put it into an or and then negate it and put it into another or I'm

5
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,560
going to tie those ores to the odds and the evens or the first ones of every pair and the second

6
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:52,760
ones of every pair so every time we do clock we're going to cycle through our clock so let me do this

7
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,840
simulate reset it

8
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:08,000
so every time we're just going to cycle through this so every time I do clock it's going to switch

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,400
between one and then when I go to zero it'll do the second one one zero one zero one zero one zero

10
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:29,360
and it just keeps walking down okay so let me reset and explain how this works okay so I have

11
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:42,020
this reset all right and it comes in and it is also into the or for set one set two and it's negated

12
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:59,240
into CPU one okay so when I click reset goes high notice that one is on okay if I go low so I reset

13
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,760
it one is still on because the output from the first pair is zero and I negate it and it goes

14
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:14,420
into the or now if I go high on one it's going to pass that one to the second one high on the output

15
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:22,580
it'll make step two and then because this is negated so this is a plus one this becomes zero

16
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:28,920
again high pass it down one low on clock

17
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:38,060
passes it out the second part and that goes into step three now we're taking this as an and now

18
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,040
it was an or again this would always be one because this is going to stay one

19
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,460
so we're making an and and so this one becomes zero and this becomes zero

20
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:56,360
so then we can just go clock clock step four clock clock step five

21
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,300
clock clock

22
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,300
Step six, clock, clock, step seven, all right?

23
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,920
And so we've cycled through all seven.

24
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,540
Then what we're gonna wanna do

25
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:16,540
and is we're gonna wanna look at our circuit appearance,

26
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,320
which I'll show you a diagram

27
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,600
and maybe it'll look something like this.

28
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,060
Okay, I have a clock on the left, reset on the right

29
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,460
and then I have my seven outputs, all right?

30
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,920
And now what I'm gonna do is probably at some point,

31
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,380
I'll not change the appearance,

32
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,500
but what I'll do is I'll take the output from seven

33
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,840
and put it into reset.

34
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,500
And that way when seven goes high, reset goes high

35
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,140
and it resets the whole thing and we start over, all right?

36
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,720
So that's pretty much how the stepper works

37
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,900
and drawing it up.

38
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,420
Hopefully you walk through it

39
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,120
and it makes sense to you on how the stepper works

40
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,120
because this is how we're gonna choose what we're doing.
