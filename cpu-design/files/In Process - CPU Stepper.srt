00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,260
Aloha.

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,980
So what I want to do is show a little bit about how

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,440
this stepper is going to work and discuss a little bit.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,800
So I have my little unit I have with

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,680
the two memory bits tied together,

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,280
and what I'm going to show you is how this chain works.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,080
So right now the input to the first one is zero.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,340
So let me change the input to one and I hit set one.

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:37,380
Now, every other memory item is connected to set one.

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,160
So the first one of every pair is connected to set one.

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,240
So I'm going to set that so that the output is one,

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,120
turn my input off, and then I'm going to set two.

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,160
What set two is going to do is it's tied to

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,120
the memory bit of every even one,

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,500
so two, four, six, eight,

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,520
or the second one of every pair.

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,820
So what that will do, we'll pass that input one

18
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,560
that's stored in the first one,

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,120
it'll pass it to the output,

20
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,960
which will be the first item,

21
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,940
and pass it as the input to the next one.

22
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,900
So then we'll turn set two off and then just go set one again,

23
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,640
which will pass it to the second part,

24
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,480
and pass the zero into the second one.

25
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,520
So that's set one of the first one,

26
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,420
and then I'll hit set two again,

27
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:38,060
and it'll turn off the first item and turn on the second item.

28
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:43,560
I'll turn that off, I'll go set one to pass it down one,

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,120
set two to turn off the second one and go to the third one.

30
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,440
And so I just keep cycling, set one on off,

31
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,620
set two on off, move to the next one, set one on off,

32
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,320
set two on off, move to the next one, move to the next one, move to the next one.

33
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,340
Set one on off, move to the next one, move to the next one, move to the next one.

34
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,740
Set one on off, set two on off, move to the last one,

35
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,100
and then set one on off, set two on off,

36
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,420
sends the zero, so they're all back to zero.

37
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,460
Okay, so that's how the stepper works.

38
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,260
It's gonna just step through,

39
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,660
and what we're gonna do is we're actually gonna tie

40
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,800
the output, this last one, back to the input

41
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,220
so that we actually just cycle through six.

42
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,680
So we're gonna add another one to the left foot.

43
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,500
Basically, this is how this works.

44
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,820
So that we are able to sequentially step through

45
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:36,260
different items, basically using the set one, set two,

46
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,700
set one, set two, set one, set two.

47
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,780
Okay, so that's how our stepper's gonna work.

48
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:46,380
And then I'll show you the finished circuit

49
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,780
and walk through how that works.

50
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,620
Thanks.
