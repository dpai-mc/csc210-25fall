                    <p><strong>[00:00:00]</strong> Aloha. So what I want to talk a little bit about in this video is how a transistor works.</p>
                    <p><strong>[00:00:09]</strong> Now in the big scheme of things, it's not critical that you understand transistors.</p>
                    <p><strong>[00:00:15]</strong> Okay, what you need to know is that transistors are kind of the base unit.</p>
                    <p><strong>[00:00:20]</strong> Okay, and we put transistors together or we use transistors to make gates.</p>
                    <p><strong>[00:00:26]</strong> Okay, and then we take gates, which for us is going to be our fundamental or atomic unit of stuff,</p>
                    <p><strong>[00:00:35]</strong> and we use those gates to make digital circuits to do stuff.</p>
                    <p><strong>[00:00:39]</strong> Okay, so I'm just going to explore a little bit about a transistor, what it is, how it works.</p>
                    <p><strong>[00:00:45]</strong> Okay, and I'm going to simplify it a little bit just to make it easier to understand.</p>
                    <p><strong>[00:00:50]</strong> Okay, so let's look at this and let's call this our transistor.</p>
                    <p><strong>[00:00:56]</strong> Okay, so a transistor has a bunch of connections,</p>
                    <p><strong>[01:05:00]</strong> but there's two primary ones that we're concerned with first,</p>
                    <p><strong>[01:08:00]</strong> and one is to a 5-volt source voltage.</p>
                    <p><strong>[01:15:00]</strong> Okay, so V source equals 5 volts.</p>
                    <p><strong>[01:24:00]</strong> Okay, 5 volts.</p>
                    <p><strong>[01:26:00]</strong> The other side of the transistor here connects to ground.</p>
                    <p><strong>[01:32:00]</strong> Okay, and what ground is,</p>
                    <p><strong>[01:35:00]</strong> ground is just like a big energy sink.</p>
                    <p><strong>[01:40:00]</strong> So electricity will flow to ground.</p>
                    <p><strong>[01:42:00]</strong> Okay, so electricity always follows the path of least resistance.</p>
                    <p><strong>[01:46:00]</strong> It's like water flowing downhill.</p>
                    <p><strong>[01:50:00]</strong> And so if it can get to ground, it'll go to ground because the ground is a huge potential.</p>
                    <p><strong>[01:55:00]</strong> It'll absorb all the electricity there's known to man and be happy.</p>
                    <p><strong>[02:01:00]</strong> Now, we have two more critical things to the transistor.</p>
                    <p><strong>[02:06:00]</strong> We have our voltage in, which is going to be our 0 or 1, right?</p>
                    <p><strong>[02:10:00]</strong> And we have our voltage out, which is going to be our 0 or 1 going out.</p>
                    <p><strong>[02:15:00]</strong> Okay, and we know that typically a 1 equals, you know, 5 volts,</p>
                    <p><strong>[02:23:00]</strong> and a 0 equals 0 volts.</p>
                    <p><strong>[02:38:00]</strong> So we have our voltage in.</p>
                    <p><strong>[02:44:00]</strong> This is our voltage in, which will be our 0 or 1 coming in.</p>
                    <p><strong>[02:52:00]</strong> And then we have a voltage out.</p>
                    <p><strong>[02:58:00]</strong> Except what we do, or what we used to do, we don't do this anymore,</p>
                    <p><strong>[03:02:00]</strong> but what we used to do is we had a resistor here.</p>
                    <p><strong>[03:14:00]</strong> This is our voltage out, and this is a resistor.</p>
                    <p><strong>[03:20:00]</strong> And what a resistor does is it resists the flow of electricity.</p>
                    <p><strong>[03:24:00]</strong> So if this electricity here, this 5 volts, if it can go to ground,</p>
                    <p><strong>[03:28:00]</strong> it's going to all go to ground, and none of it's going to go that way.</p>
                    <p><strong>[03:32:00]</strong> It can't go to ground.</p>
                    <p><strong>[03:33:00]</strong> It's all going to go through this resistor.</p>
                    <p><strong>[03:35:00]</strong> It'll go, well, there's no place else for it to go,</p>
                    <p><strong>[03:39:00]</strong> so it'll go across the resistor.</p>
                    <p><strong>[03:43:00]</strong> And so what we have in here, inside the resistor,</p>
                    <p><strong>[03:47:00]</strong> we have kind of a little, switch, okay,</p>
                    <p><strong>[03:53:00]</strong> that may or may not, it may be connected or it may not be connected.</p>
                    <p><strong>[03:58:00]</strong> And that's what it is.</p>
                    <p><strong>[03:59:00]</strong> A transistor is just a little switch.</p>
                    <p><strong>[04:02:00]</strong> That's going to either let that flow there or make it flow there.</p>
                    <p><strong>[04:09:00]</strong> when we have a zero input,</p>
                    <p><strong>[04:12:00]</strong> which means zero volts,</p>
                    <p><strong>[04:17:00]</strong> what happens is the switch is open.</p>
                    <p><strong>[04:26:00]</strong> meaning all the electricity is going to flow this way,</p>
                    <p><strong>[04:33:00]</strong> right, and it's going to run into dead end,</p>
                    <p><strong>[04:36:00]</strong> and then it's going to go up and go through the resistor.</p>
                    <p><strong>[04:43:00]</strong> So, when voltage is zero in,</p>
                    <p><strong>[04:49:00]</strong> zero signals in, our Vout equals five volts, which is one.</p>
                    <p><strong>[05:10:00]</strong> the same as a one.</p>
                    <p><strong>[05:14:00]</strong> Now, when we have a one in, that means five volts in.</p>
                    <p><strong>[05:22:00]</strong> our transistor is closed.</p>
                    <p><strong>[05:27:00]</strong> So now it makes a connection and all the voltage comes here and flows straight through and goes to ground.</p>
                    <p><strong>[05:39:00]</strong> in this case, Vout equals zero volts, which is a zero.</p>
                    <p><strong>[05:52:00]</strong> a simple transistor is a NOT gate</p>
                    <p><strong>[06:04:00]</strong> because when we have zero in, we get one out,</p>
                    <p><strong>[06:09:00]</strong> and when we have a one in, we get zero out.</p>
                    <p><strong>[06:15:00]</strong> all a transistor is, an electrical switch.</p>
                    <p><strong>[06:21:00]</strong> sort of a mechanical silicon switch that when I have voltage in, it closes so that electricity from the source flows to ground.</p>
                    <p><strong>[06:33:00]</strong> And when I don't have electricity in on this side, it opens, not letting any of this source voltage flow through.</p>
                    <p><strong>[06:42:00]</strong> So the source voltage will go on the output.</p>
                    <p><strong>[06:47:00]</strong> So that's kind of a transistor, how it works.</p>
                    <p><strong>[06:49:00]</strong> And that's really all I want to talk about, about transistors.</p>
                    <p><strong>[06:53:00]</strong> Other than you can take transistors, you know, for two inputs, we need a minimum of two transistors, one for each input.</p>
                    <p><strong>[07:02:00]</strong> And we put them in different configurations, parallel to the source voltage, series to the source voltage, to get different results going outward.</p>
                    <p><strong>[07:16:00]</strong> And we can add other, more transistors on the outputs and mix the outputs together and stuff like that to get more, to create different gates, to get the responses that we want for the different types of gates.</p>
                    <p><strong>[07:33:00]</strong> And in the discussion below, it talks about how to build a a NOT gate, an AND gate, a NAND gate, a NOR gate, an OR gate, all those kind of things.</p>
                    <p><strong>[07:44:00]</strong> that's transistor.</p>
                    <p><strong>[07:49:00]</strong> And, it's our base unit of stuff because it's what gates are made from.</p>
                    <p><strong>[07:56:00]</strong> But we're going to work at the gate level.</p>
                    <p><strong>[07:58:00]</strong> So, we're going to hide the details of transistors, you know, abstract away from transistors and use gates.</p>

            <h2 id="what-is-transistor">What is a Transistor?</h2>
            <p>A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power. It is one of the fundamental building blocks of modern electronic devices, often described as a tiny, electronically controlled switch or a faucet that controls the flow of electricity.</p>

            <h3>Types of Transistors:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs):</strong> These were among the first transistors. They have three terminals:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Base (B):</strong> The control input. A small current here controls a larger current.</li>
                        <li><strong>Collector (C):</strong> Where the main current enters.</li>
                        <li><strong>Emitter (E):</strong> Where the main current leaves.</li>
                    </ul>
                    BJTs come in NPN and PNP types, referring to their semiconductor layering.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Field-Effect Transistors (FETs):</strong> More common in modern integrated circuits. They also have three terminals:

                        <li><strong>Gate (G):</strong> The control input. An electric field here controls the current flow.</li>
                        <li><strong>Drain (D):</strong> Where the main current enters.</li>
                        <li><strong>Source (S):</strong> Where the main current leaves.</li>

            <h2 id="how-transistor-works">How a Transistor Works</h2>
            <p>At its core, a transistor uses a small electrical signal to control a larger one.</p>

            <h3>For a BJT (NPN type):</h3>
            <p>When a small current is applied to the Base, it "opens the gate" for a much larger current to flow from the Collector to the Emitter. No current at the Base means the "gate" is closed. This allows it to amplify signals or act as a digital switch.</p>

            <h3>For a MOSFET (N-channel type):</h3>
            <p>Applying a voltage to the Gate creates an electric field that forms a conductive channel between the Source and the Drain, allowing current to flow. Without Gate voltage, the channel is non-conductive. This precise control makes MOSFETs ideal for digital logic, as they consume very little power when idle in CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) configurations.</p>

            <h2 id="logic-gates">Simple Logic Gates Using Transistors</h2>
            <p>Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of digital circuits, performing basic logical operations on binary inputs (0s and 1s) to produce a single binary output. We'll look at CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) implementations, which are power-efficient and widely used.</p>
            <p>In CMOS:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>NMOS Transistors:</strong> Conduct when the gate is high (1), block when the gate is low (0).</li>
                <li><strong>PMOS Transistors:</strong> Conduct when the gate is low (0), block when the gate is high (1).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let "high" (near supply voltage, Vdd) be logical "1" and "low" (near ground, GND) be logical "0".</p>

            <h3>1. NOT Gate (Inverter)</h3>
            <p>Inverts the input: 0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0.</p>
            <img src="images/not_gate.png" alt="Circuit diagram of a CMOS NOT gate with a PMOS and NMOS transistor connected in series, and its truth table showing input 0 gives output 1, and input 1 gives output 0." width="400">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Input A is 0 (Low):</strong> PMOS ON, NMOS OFF. Output Y is 1 (connected to Vdd).</li>
                <li><strong>Input A is 1 (High):</strong> PMOS OFF, NMOS ON. Output Y is 0 (connected to GND).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. NAND Gate</h3>
            <p>Output is 0 only if ALL inputs are 1. Otherwise, output is 1.</p>
            <img src="images/nand_gate.png" alt="Circuit diagram of a 2-input CMOS NAND gate. It shows two PMOS transistors in parallel connected to VDD, and two NMOS transistors in series connected to GND. Inputs A and B control the gates of both PMOS and NMOS transistors. Includes the NAND gate truth table." width="500">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pull-up Network (PMOS in parallel):</strong> If A or B (or both) are 0, at least one PMOS turns ON, pulling output to 1.</li>
                <li><strong>Pull-down Network (NMOS in series):</strong> Both A and B must be 1 for both NMOS to turn ON, pulling output to 0.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. NOR Gate</h3>
            <p>Output is 1 only if ALL inputs are 0. Otherwise, output is 0.</p>
            <img src="images/nor_gate.png" alt="Circuit diagram of a 2-input CMOS NOR gate. It shows two PMOS transistors in series connected to VDD, and two NMOS transistors in parallel connected to GND. Inputs A and B control the gates of both PMOS and NMOS transistors. Includes the NOR gate truth table." width="500">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pull-up Network (PMOS in series):</strong> Both A and B must be 0 for both PMOS to turn ON, pulling output to 1.</li>
                <li><strong>Pull-down Network (NMOS in parallel):</strong> If A or B (or both) are 1, at least one NMOS turns ON, pulling output to 0.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. AND Gate</h3>
            <p>Output is 1 only if ALL inputs are 1. Can be built by connecting a NAND gate to a NOT gate.</p>

            <h3>5. OR Gate</h3>
            <p>Output is 1 if ANY input is 1. Can be built by connecting a NOR gate to a NOT gate.</p>
            <img src="images/or_gate.png" alt="Circuit diagram illustrating how to build an OR gate from a NOR gate followed by a NOT gate. Shows a 2-input NOR gate connected to a 1-input NOT gate, with the final output being the OR function. Includes the OR gate truth table." width="600">
