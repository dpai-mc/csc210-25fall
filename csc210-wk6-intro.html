Aloha and welcome to week six of computer organization and architecture.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,400
So this week we're in our second week of looking at assembly language and trying to understand

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,520
the different instructions and how they work. So this week we're going to talk about arithmetic

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,480
and logic instructions which are tend to be the R-type and I-type instructions.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,440
Okay, so the first part of this is there's a lot of

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,640
instructions. Okay, there's a lot of instructions

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:48,720
in the arithmetic and logic section of MIPS. Okay, so there's addition and subtraction,

8
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,480
multiplication, division, and logical operations.

9
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,480
Control.

10
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,200
Flow, which is branching and jumping, and procedures.

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,280
Those will be coming in the next week or two.

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:09,360
All right, so this week there's a lot in here, so take your time, please take your time,

13
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,800
read through this. I know it seems like it's a lot, but it'll help you understand

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,080
each instruction and how it works. All right, so now here's the add, how to add integers,

15
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,640
add unsigned integers. So the U stands for unsigned, which means there's no negatives,

16
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:41,680
basically everything's a positive number. And so when we say an 8-bit integer there's 256

17
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:52,960
values it can represent, which I think is negative 127 to positiveâ€“ negative 128 to positive 127.

18
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,840
Okay

19
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:02,320
an unsigned 8-bit integer is 0 to 255 because there's no negatives okay so that's what the

20
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,840
u means unsigned meaning you're only dealing with positive integers okay and they talk about

21
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:15,440
larger numbers which are 32-bit numbers not 8-bit numbers as my example gave you

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,480
because this is the 32-bit system you could use 32-bit numbers okay

23
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,680
add immediate is where this immediate is you actually put the value in

24
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:42,400
okay so assuming t1 is 50 if i execute this number add add i into t0 put the t1 plus 100

25
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:49,360
right and so if you thought i would get 150 because 100 plus 50 t0 would have 150 in it

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,240
that's that immediate so some of these will have these

27
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,400
execute examples and others will just have this is the command okay subtraction

28
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:10,800
all right so um you know for subtraction notice there's no immediate subtraction

29
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,760
because and elsewhere we'll go through it in immediate subtraction we actually do

30
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,080
negative addition we don't use the sub command

31
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,280
okay you're gonna you want to subtract something

32
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,800
admits what you do is you add the negative of the value not

33
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,920
add the value but anyway so addition multiplication

34
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:46,400
make sure again you go through this multiplication um it will give you talk about what's in mf high

35
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,820
mf low okay why are those there it has to do with multiplication and division okay so you're going to

36
00:03:53,820 --> 00:04:01,440
can read through that. And then there is this thing called bitwise shifting. Okay

37
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,700
so bitwise shifting is when you multiply by powers of 2. If I shift it left every

38
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,600
time I move it one left that's like multiplying by 2. Okay so if I move it 2

39
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:18,660
left that's 2 squared or 4. 3 left is 2 cubed or 8. 4 left is 2 to the 4th or 16.

40
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:25,960
Right so I multiply by 2, 4, 8, or 16 kind of thing. Just by moving the bits left.

41
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,380
Okay so this talks about that. Talks about when to use it. Why you would use

42
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:35,600
shift rather than malt. Malt is general purpose. When it's not a multiple of 2

43
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:44,020
you have to use malt. But when it's a multiple of 2 you can use malt or shift

44
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,420
left. Okay.

45
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:54,880
And a lot of times I don't know if ours does it but a lot of true MIPS

46
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,900
processors what they're gonna do is they're gonna look at your multiple

47
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,860
instruction if you use malt. And if it's a power of 2 they're gonna convert it to

48
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,020
a shift left instruction rather than a malt instruction. You know when it

49
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:13,660
converts it to actual code to run. It'll do that automatically. Okay so anyway

50
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,420
read through about bitwise shifting as well as multiplication.

51
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:28,860
Same with division. Division works similarly in that you do division. Okay.

52
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:35,660
And the results go into MF high and MF low. And which one has what in it. You

53
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,160
want to understand that. It's going to tell you MF low is the quotient. MF high

54
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,240
is the remainder. Because it's all integer division is what we're doing

55
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,640
right now. And again you could use bitwise

56
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,380
shifting when you divide by 2. Except instead of shifting left now you

57
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:59,020
shift right. Okay. Every time every time a bit moves one right it's like dividing

58
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:07,000
by 2. All right. So that's a shift left shift right. Multiplication.

59
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,600
You always have to go back to this main page. Okay. To get here. And the

60
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,540
last part is logical operations. Load up or immediate. You definitely

61
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:23,540
want to read through these. You're gonna have to use these in the homework. Okay.

62
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:31,540
So load up or immediate. You know generate code. Try it. You know and and

63
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:39,300
bitwise and what does that do? 12 and 10. Okay. So what you do is you take 12

64
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:46,080
binary and end it with 10 binary. So basically you basically like to line

65
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,520
them up. So take the 12 bit number. Like that. And then you're gonna add the

66
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:57,020
what is 12 in binary? And you line that up with what is 8 in, 10 in binary. 12 is an 8 and a 4.

67
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:08,540
So 0 is 1, 2, 4, 8. So that's, if I look at just four bits, 12 would be 1, 1, 0, 0. 10 would be

68
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:17,500
1, 0, 1, 0. I line them up in the result is wherever the columns are both 1,

69
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:23,820
that goes into the result of an AND. Right, 1 and 1 is 1. Anything that, where they're different,

70
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:35,180
is a 0 or there is at least one 0, it's a 0. So 1, 1, 0, 0 ANDed with 1, 0, 1, 1 results in 1, 0, 0, 0.

71
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:45,340
Okay, which is 8. Okay, so I just looked at the last four because all the first four are all 0s.

72
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,340
Okay,

73
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:53,020
so try to try out different numbers, play with that a little bit. Same AND immediate

74
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:57,660
works the same way except for now you're checking it to a value you give it.

75
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:07,820
Same with ORs. How do ORs work? OR immediate. How does ORs work or exclusive ORs work?

76
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:17,420
Okay, these just weren't exactly like the logic gates you did earlier in our logic sim, except for

77
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:24,940
now we're doing it through assembly commands. Okay, exclusive OR with an immediate,

78
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:31,340
a NOR. Okay, this is a NOT OR or bitwise NOR.

79
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:40,460
So that's an OR inverted. So shift left logical, shift left logical variable,

80
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,940
shift right logical, shift right arithmetic,

81
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:56,140
all right, shift right logical variable, shift right arithmetic variable.

82
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:03,340
So these are all different commands that you can use within MARS and MIPS.

83
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:10,380
So please try to understand them and read through them. You won't memorize them, but that's okay.

84
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,180
But read through them to know what is there and hopefully you remember what is there when it comes

85
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,860
time to actually do some programs.

86
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,020
And you might have to look some stuff up. There's a live MIPS simulator,

87
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:29,660
you can type in some code and you can run it, and it'll tell you what's in the registers, based on

88
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:37,420
your code. All right, and you can reset it, write a different program, and then exercises,

89
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,020
there are two exercises. There's a simple addition aushed number first,

90
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,340
okay.

91
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:50,320
the value of 15 and register t0 and 27 and t1 add them together and store the

92
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,880
result in s0 so it's just looking for that code it's not going to check your

93
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,460
solution when you're done you can go show solution it'll show you what the

94
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:07,460
basic solution looks like for that problem same with subtract immediate

95
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:18,000
yeah all right so that's kind of the basics and then there is a second page

96
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:27,000
on about how to program in myths in Mars but it's program hound to walks through

97
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,860
a sample program which is right here it's written right here dot Google main

98
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,200
dot text main

99
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,440
dot text main

100
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:45,600
load immediate Li load word add sub load immediate this call dot data value

101
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,500
dot word 12 you can read the comments okay see the pound sign everything after

102
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,620
the hashtag I guess I should call the hashtag everything else to the hashtag

103
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,920
is a comment on that line so the compiler that compiles us or the

104
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,400
assembler I just call it assembler it takes the assembly and converts it the

105
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,180
machine code

106
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,220
it's there to read this so as you can see right here it's diffÃ©rentes problems

107
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,280
different in code is our H apply a background and print and this is just

108
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,480
referring to how the file actually runs in this class you can come up with more

109
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,160
you run this it's kind of broken down a little bit in that actually this one is

110
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,080
sort of are these the any of the two well this is an arbitrary label if we

111
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,940
face go to the other side title and write every single line of your program

112
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:30,580
comment of what does this line do all right and so on I'll go to the program

113
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:35,600
structure and so what it's called well me me what is like text mean what does

114
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,020
main mean when does that data mean I do a bunch of logicide website and ET tag to

115
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:43,580
mean okay what is value dot word and it talks about each of these global main

116
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:49,580
means this why do you we use it what happens if you don't use it now I'm

117
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:54,720
gonna tell you you could leave it out it doesn't affect your program so much if

118
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:02,340
you have it or not I tend to use it it's kind of like in Java future program in

119
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:08,160
Java is you have that console program public static void main and if you just

120
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:15,740
had in there a function called to you know start here or whatever my program

121
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:22,340
method where in that my program is where your all your program is then that's

122
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:27,840
kind of this is this is global main says start at main globally and it's

123
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,780
basically creating a function called main okay

124
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,320
and the reason we

125
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,080
do that it's easier to integrate with other code when we do it that way in the

126
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:47,560
modules for this section okay I'm saying in this myths assembly you could also

127
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:55,200
look at these tutorials 1 8 through 12 and 35 might help you with the homework

128
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,760
the guy that did these does not use dot global main just code right through them

129
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:11,740
all right and that's fine it works it's just not the standard way that most

130
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:19,780
people this code okay using but that going mean don't put that go remain your

131
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:24,500
code will run at least as far as I've seen your code will run I prefer using

132
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,420
that global main myself okay then it ties out text what does that do what is that very data for verIFX and so I'll talk more about that in a second

133
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:38,540
to do gives you a couple little things here this word like value colon that

134
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:44,660
clearly creates a variable named value it's a size word which means is 32 bits

135
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:53,720
and it's holding the value 12 okay here there's an array called array each

136
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,920
element in the array is a word and it's hope the first element is one the second

137
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,840
element is two and the third element is three and the third one is a variable

138
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:12,960
called message and it's a ASCII Z meaning a null terminated string of ASCII

139
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:19,600
characters and that string is the word hello okay that's what that data means

140
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,840
so that data is where how we create variables and store values and in our

141
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,360
program if we load a word we can reference the

142
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:28,900
variable

143
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:37,460
by name instead of by register because it's not in a register it's in memory

144
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,520
all right so and then the instructions talks about all the instructions what

145
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:48,120
do they mean and then the data section I said the data section how that works

146
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,160
what they mean and then there's a simulation for this program which is a

147
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:58,900
step-by-step through so you could go you start the execution and it

148
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:05,620
does line four first it says load immediate dollar sign t2 25 well then t2

149
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:10,180
will have 25 and loading immediate value 25 in the registry to you that's

150
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:14,820
what we did notice memory value 12 is already there because it's part of our

151
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:20,800
main code in our dot data section value is starting the word 12 and then you do

152
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:27,220
next step which says I'm gonna do load line 5 which says okay so you can go

153
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,100
through each of these and

154
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:33,880
and it'll go through each step what does this step do what does this step do what

155
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,960
is this step do is this step do and that's all there's done because the rest

156
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:46,600
is just data the other thing I will say is I do use this format actually this is

157
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:54,580
a small program that I wrote just for this guide this is the structure I use I

158
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,340
have the dot text first I do when I start with my program and I have the dot

159
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:05,060
at the bottom after my program is where I put all my data some people put that

160
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,920
data at the front you put it at the front if you want you don't want to put

161
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,540
it at the end you can put it at the end it doesn't matter it seems to work both ways for me`;
