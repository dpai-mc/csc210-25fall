                [cite_start]<span data-start="10.2" data-end="16.14" tabindex="0" role="button">And so what we're going to start with is a little review here of Binary Edition, the basics.</span> [cite: 3]
                [cite_start]<span data-start="16.58" data-end="20.62" tabindex="0" role="button">So we sort of went over it last time, but we didn't really cover it real close.</span> [cite: 4]
                [cite_start]<span data-start="20.62" data-end="30.18" tabindex="0" role="button">So I put up a summary kind of activity for you to look at Boolean Edition and it's kind of foundational.</span> [cite: 5]
                [cite_start]<span data-start="30.64" data-end="32.78" tabindex="0" role="button">And so you really need to understand that.</span> [cite: 6]
                <span data-start="32.98" data-end="45.68" tabindex="0" role="button">So if you're struggling with that a little bit, take some time, review the addition and subtraction review that I've posted here, along with the example interactive calculator that you can use.</span>
                [cite_start]<span data-start="46.3" data-end="49.88" tabindex="0" role="button">OK, and it talks also about two's complement and how you do negative numbers.</span> [cite: 8]
                <span data-start="50.62" data-end="57.88" tabindex="0" role="button">And add them, so basically, if you want to subtract the number, you convert it to negative and add it.</span>
                [cite_start]<span data-start="59.5" data-end="101.92" tabindex="0" role="button">Right, because adding a negative is the same as subtraction, so.</span> [cite: 11]
                [cite_start]<span data-start="103.34" data-end="107.1" tabindex="0" role="button">OK, so and that's what this first part is, I'm not going to go through it in detail.</span> [cite: 12]
                [cite_start]<span data-start="120.62" data-end="133.7" tabindex="0" role="button">If you struggle at all with conversion between binary and decimal, if that's if you're still struggling with that, it doesn't make a lot of sense.</span> [cite: 15]

                <span data-start="139.74" data-end="146.76" tabindex="0" role="button">OK, and so it's a gamified approach to just basically doing a lot of conversions. [cite_start]All right.</span> [cite: 17]
                <span data-start="147.18" data-end="154.64" tabindex="0" role="button">And so through sheer repetition, it helps you. Learn, I better understand how that works.</span>
                [cite_start]<span data-start="203.94" data-end="208.32" tabindex="0" role="button">OK, you can say play game instructions, you can see in the background these columns.</span> [cite: 21]
                <span data-start="209.38" data-end="219.64" tabindex="0" role="button">So what it does is when there's a number here, like the number two, it wants you to select the bits to match the number. [cite_start]And then once you do, it goes away.</span> [cite: 22]
                [cite_start]<span data-start="220.62" data-end="221.52" tabindex="0" role="button">Four and one.</span> [cite: 23]

                [cite_start]<span data-start="233.2" data-end="237.84" tabindex="0" role="button">And you just go through these and it has multiple levels.</span> [cite: 25]
                [cite_start]<span data-start="251.24" data-end="254.5" tabindex="0" role="button">You basically run out of space, kind of like a Tetris thing.</span> [cite: 27]

                [cite_start]<span data-start="346.24" data-end="350.6" tabindex="0" role="button">OK, the other thing I should mention is that I created a course tutor.</span> [cite: 36]
                [cite_start]<span data-start="356.24" data-end="400.64" tabindex="0" role="button">It links to a chat bot that you can ask questions of.</span> [cite: 38]

                [cite_start]<span data-start="508.0" data-end="509.86" tabindex="0" role="button">It's fairly extensive and comprehensive.</span> [cite: 48]
                [cite_start]<span data-start="511.18" data-end="514.9" tabindex="0" role="button">Basically, it says you're going to use it and you're going to use it as intended.</span> [cite: 49]

                [cite_start]<span data-start="521.22" data-end="526.1" tabindex="0" role="button">OK, so that's so please read this and take a look at it.</span> [cite: 51]
                [cite_start]<span data-start="550.62" data-end="613.04" tabindex="0" role="button">OK, so this video will get posted here, so we want to talk a little about Boolean algebra, what it is, what logic gates are, maybe what circuits are, truth tables, conversion between representations of Boolean expressions, two tables, gate diagrams and sometimes recognize patterns, sometimes you can see patterns in any more sense.</span> [cite: 56]
                [cite_start]<span data-start="620.56" data-end="635.76" tabindex="0" role="button">There are these one, two, three, these six primary gates that we care about and and gate and or gate and not gate and and gate and nor gate and in. XOR gate, which is exclusive or or ZOR gate.</span> [cite: 59]
                [cite_start]<span data-start="637.26" data-end="645.84" tabindex="0" role="button">OK, so an and gate works just like in programming when you're branching, you have an if statement inside your if you have a conditional statement.</span> [cite: 60]
                <span data-start="646.96" data-end="654.34" tabindex="0" role="button">OK, that is true or false. Well, when you have a compound conditional. [cite_start]You usually have two conditions connected with an and or an or.</span> [cite: 62]
                [cite_start]<span data-start="655.24" data-end="706.84" tabindex="0" role="button">OK, and an and is exactly that it says, hey, when both inputs are high or true, think of true, false, I'm thinking true, false, one is true, zero is false.</span> [cite: 63]
                <span data-start="742.16" data-end="746.42" tabindex="0" role="button">These are the laws of bullying algebra. [cite_start]When you look at this, a a is an input.</span> [cite: 70]
                <span data-start="755.08" data-end="801.12" tabindex="0" role="button">Dot is an and. [cite_start]So a and one equals a OK.</span> [cite: 72]
                [cite_start]<span data-start="801.66" data-end="808.16" tabindex="0" role="button">A or plus is an or a or zero equals an A. And we use.</span> [cite: 73]
                [cite_start]<span data-start="834.26" data-end="838.6" tabindex="0" role="button">There's a lot of different notations, but a bar over it means not a.</span> [cite: 77]
                <span data-start="838.62" data-end="858.58" tabindex="0" role="button">So it means you've taken a and you've not at it. So a times not a equals zero because if a is one, not a is zero. A is zero, not a is one OK, so this community of it doesn't matter which one comes first associative doesn't matter how you pair them.</span>
                <span data-start="858.58" data-end="908.68" tabindex="0" role="button">If they're all the same. Um, they're all times or they're all plus. [cite_start]It doesn't matter which order you do them and pair them up in and then to Morgan's law, which says.</span> [cite: 83]
                [cite_start]<span data-start="922.8" data-end="928.08" tabindex="0" role="button">You can group if you have a, B and C, you can group multiple things and create a truth table.</span> [cite: 85]
                <span data-start="943.32" data-end="948.26" tabindex="0" role="button">And like I said, apparently I got it. [cite_start]I have to update this, but I will update the.</span> [cite: 88]
                [cite_start]<span data-start="955.62" data-end="959.2" tabindex="0" role="button">All right, so, um, really focus on gates, how they work.</span> [cite: 90]
                [cite_start]<span data-start="959.9" data-end="1012.1" tabindex="0" role="button">Understand and and in an or a not means just reverse it and and is not and meaning take the results from an and gate and reverse all the answers.</span> [cite: 91]
                [cite_start]<span data-start="1035.1" data-end="1048.4" tabindex="0" role="button">What it says is that when, um, the if you're doing a two input when the two inputs are the same and you get zero and when they're different, you get one.</span> [cite: 94]
                <span data-start="1118.76" data-end="1119.98" tabindex="0" role="button">OK, because it's.</span>
