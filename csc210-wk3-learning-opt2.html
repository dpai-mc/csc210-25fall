                        <p><strong>[00:00:00]</strong> Aloha and welcome to week three. This week we're talking a little bit about digital circuits,</p>
                        <p><strong>[00:00:06]</strong> how we take gates and make circuits. In particular we're going to look at adders and decoders.</p>
                        <p><strong>[00:00:13]</strong> Okay so first I posted as part of this, I posted this a little bit on transistors,</p>
                        <p><strong>[00:00:21]</strong> what a transistor is and how do you make a gate out of a transistor. So there's a short like</p>
                        <p><strong>[00:00:25]</strong> eight minute video here that you can watch. It talks about how transistors work and then</p>
                        <p><strong>[00:00:31]</strong> there's a lot of discussion about how to build gates from transistors. Okay it's not a requirement</p>
                        <p><strong>[00:00:39]</strong> that you totally understand this but I think it's good for you to watch this and get the basics</p>
                        <p><strong>[00:00:42]</strong> so that you understand how a gate is made from a transistor.</p>
                        <p><strong>[00:00:46]</strong> We're not going to deal with this level of detail again. It's just to give you the foundation,</p>
                        <p><strong>[00:00:50]</strong> the foundational knowledge. Okay so that's the first thing you'll see on the canvas page</p>
                        <p><strong>[00:00:54]</strong> that there's a link to that video. So please watch that. And then the next topic is,</p>
                        <p><strong>[00:01:00]</strong> how do we build adders? And there's two videos here that I want you to watch. One is</p>
                        <p><strong>[00:01:05]</strong> from a professor, I think it is at Cornell. I think it's a really well done video. He talks</p>
                        <p><strong>[00:01:09]</strong> about how to add, how to subtract, how to deal with sign bits, how to do a carry,</p>
                        <p><strong>[00:01:14]</strong> how to do an overflow, how to detect an overflow. So it's a good summary of all things</p>
                        <p><strong>[00:01:19]</strong> we've been talking about, addition and subtraction in binary. Okay so then so that's</p>
                        <p><strong>[00:01:24]</strong> the first video. The second video is somebody else. It's not a great video but it does</p>
                        <p><strong>[01:30,000]</strong> talk about how do you build a half adder and a full adder from logic gates. Okay so it's</p>
                        <p><strong>[01:34,000]</strong> a pretty simple process and I think you'll see that when you watch the video. Then</p>
                        <p><strong>[01:38,000]</strong> there's an activity, a circuits activity here for you, which is actually going to</p>
                        <p><strong>[01:43,000]</strong> have you build in Logisim a half adder, a full adder and then a four-bit ripple adder.</p>
                        <p><strong>[01:49,000]</strong> Okay so then we switch gears a little bit. We're going to talk about decoders. And here's</p>
                        <p><strong>[01:54,000]</strong> a good video on decoders. It's about five minutes. I suggest you watch this because</p>
                        <p><strong>[01:59,000]</strong> it gives you a good feel for what a decoder is and why you need it. And then here's a</p>
                        <p><strong>[02:03,000]</strong> second activity to build a decoder. There's two parts to this. One is to build</p>
                        <p><strong>[02:08,000]</strong> a three by eight decoder in Logisim. And then the second part is just a text answer</p>
                        <p><strong>[02:13,000]</strong> for you to give me on how would you take two three by eights and make a four by sixteen.</p>
                        <p><strong>[02:18,000]</strong> All right? And then lastly we have the assignment for the week. The assignment for the week</p>
                        <p><strong>[02:23,000]</strong> is very simple. I just want you to upload your two Logisim circuits, one for the adder,</p>
                        <p><strong>[02:29,000]</strong> one for the decoder and then a written answer on how you would extend the three by eight</p>
                        <p><strong>[02:34,000]</strong> to a four by sixteen. So there is a submission for this week. It is a Logisim file and</p>
                        <p><strong>[02:40,000]</strong> a text answer. So there's two things I want from you. You can put them in the same file.</p>
                        <p><strong>[02:44,000]</strong> You can do a zip file. I don't care. As long as I get both. A single Logisim file with</p>
                        <p><strong>[02:49,000]</strong> the two circuits in it and the text answer. Okay. And then so let me go into a little</p>
                        <p><strong>[02:54,000]</strong> more detail now about what is a half adder, what is a full adder, what's a ripple adder,</p>
                        <p><strong>[02:58,000]</strong> what's a decoder. Okay. And then what's the assignment. Okay. So that's the agenda.</p>
                        <p><strong>[03:06,000]</strong> Okay so let's first talk about adders. What are we trying to do? We're trying to do</p>
                        <p><strong>[03:10,000]</strong> something like this where we have two four bit numbers. We're trying to add them. So</p>
                        <p><strong>[03:15,000]</strong> we start from the right. We say one plus one is two. So that's a zero with a carry.</p>
                        <p><strong>[03:19,000]</strong> Okay. One plus zero plus zero is one. Okay. One plus one is zero with a carry. Okay.</p>
                        <p><strong>[03:26,000]</strong> And then one plus one plus zero is zero with a carry. Okay. And then we have the last</p>
                        <p><strong>[03:31,000]</strong> carry. Okay. So this is what we're trying to do. This is a four bit add. All right.</p>
                        <p><strong>[03:36,000]</strong> So the first thing you want to do is you want to build a half adder. A half adder only</p>
                        <p><strong>[03:41,000]</strong> does this first column. Okay. It takes two inputs, A and B, and it generates a sum</p>
                        <p><strong>[03:47,000]</strong> and a carry. Okay. So you can create a truth table for this where you have A and B are the</p>
                        <p><strong>[03:52,000]</strong> inputs. The sum and the carry are the outputs. Okay. And then you can you can implement that</p>
                        <p><strong>[03:58,000]</strong> in logic gates. Okay. Then the second thing you want to do is you want to build a full adder.</p>
                        <p><strong>[04:03,000]</strong> So a full adder does all the other columns. What's different about the other columns is</p>
                        <p><strong>[04:08,000]</strong> you have A and B as an input, but you also have a carry in. Okay. You have three inputs.</p>
                        <p><strong>[04:13,000]</strong> Then you generate a sum and a carry out. Okay. So you're going to build a full adder that</p>
                        <p><strong>[04:18,000]</strong> has three inputs and two outputs. And one way to do that is you can use two half adders</p>
                        <p><strong>[04:24,000]</strong> to make a full adder. Okay. So you're going to do that in Logisim as a sub-circuit.</p>
                        <p><strong>[04:29,000]</strong> So you're going to make a half adder, then you're going to make a full adder. And then</p>
                        <p><strong>[04:32,000]</strong> the third step is you're going to make a four-bit ripple adder, which does this whole</p>
                        <p><strong>[04:36,000]</strong> thing. Okay. And so that is four full adders cascaded. So the carry out of one becomes</p>
                        <p><strong>[04:43,000]</strong> the carry in of the next. All right. And that's all in the activity. It's all spelled</p>
                        <p><strong>[04:47,000]</strong> out for you, what you need to do. Okay. And then so the assignment is to give me a Logisim</p>
                        <p><strong>[04:53,000]</strong> file that contains the half adder, the full adder and the four-bit ripple adder. Okay.</p>
                        <p><strong>[04:58,000]</strong> So that is that's the first part of the assignment. And it's based on the activity for the adders.</p>
                        <p><strong>[05:05,000]</strong> Okay. And so I'm hoping that this is kind of a fun little exercise for you to do to learn</p>
                        <p><strong>[05:10,000]</strong> how adders are built. Okay. Then the second part of the class for this week is decoders.</p>
                        <p><strong>[05:16,000]</strong> Okay. So what's a decoder? A decoder is a way to take a binary number and convert</p>
                        <p><strong>[05:22,000]</strong> it to a selection. Okay. So for example, if I have a two-bit number, there's four possibilities,</p>
                        <p><strong>[05:28,000]</strong> 00, 01, 10, 11. What I want to do is I want to have four outputs and depending on</p>
                        <p><strong>[05:34,000]</strong> which of the four possibilities comes in, a different output is selected. Is is turned</p>
                        <p><strong>[05:39,000]</strong> on. Okay. So this is called a two to four decoder. All right. You can also do a three</p>
                        <p><strong>[05:44,000]</strong> to eight decoder. So if you have a three-bit number, there's eight possibilities. So you</p>
                        <p><strong>[05:49,000]</strong> have eight outputs and based on what the three-bit number is, a different one of the eight outputs</p>
                        <p><strong>[05:55,000]</strong> is selected. So why do we do this? Okay. The main reason we do this is for memories.</p>
                        <p><strong>[06:01,000]</strong> So if you have a memory, let's say you have a 256 byte memory, you need to have a way to</p>
                        <p><strong>[06:08,000]</strong> select which of the 256 bytes you're interested in reading or writing. So you have an address</p>
                        <p><strong>[06:14,000]</strong> bus and that address bus is in this case eight bits because two to the eighth is 256.</p>
                        <p><strong>[06:20,000]</strong> So you have an eight-bit address and that tells you which of the 256 bytes you're interested</p>
                        <p><strong>[06:26,000]</strong> in. Okay. And so the way this is typically implemented is the 256 bytes are organized</p>
                        <p><strong>[06:33,000]</strong> as a grid. So in this case, 16 by 16. Okay. So you take four of the bits for the</p>
                        <p><strong>[06:39,000]</strong> row and four of the bits for the column. And so for the row, you have a four to sixteen</p>
                        <p><strong>[06:45,000]</strong> decoder. And for the column, you have a four to sixteen decoder. Okay. And based on the</p>
                        <p><strong>[06:50,000]</strong> four bits of the row and the four bits of the column, a single byte is selected. A single</p>
                        <p><strong>[06:56,000]</strong> one of the 256 bytes is selected that you can then either read or write. Okay. So</p>
                        <p><strong>[07:02,000]</strong> that's what a decoder is used for primarily is memories. All right. So the activity that</p>
                        <p><strong>[07:08,000]</strong> I have for you and the assignment that I have for you is to build a three to eight decoder.</p>
                        <p><strong>[07:13,000]</strong> Okay. And then the second part of it is a text answer, just for you to tell me how</p>
                        <p><strong>[07:18,000]</strong> would you take two three to eights and make a four to sixteen. Okay. And that's pretty</p>
                        <p><strong>[07:23,000]</strong> straightforward if you think about it. If you have a four-bit number, the first three bits</p>
                        <p><strong>[07:28,000]</strong> can go to both decoders, right, in parallel. And then the fourth bit, the most significant</p>
                        <p><strong>[07:34,000]</strong> bit of the four bits can be used to select which of the two decoders you're interested</p>
                        <p><strong>[07:40,000]</strong> in. Okay. So that's the idea. And there's an enable line on these decoders that allows</p>
                        <p><strong>[07:45,000]</strong> you to turn them on or off. Okay. So you're going to learn about decoders and you're going</p>
                        <p><strong>[07:49,000]</strong> to build me a three to eight decoder and then you're going to tell me how to make a four</p>
                        <p><strong>[07:53,000]</strong> to sixteen from two three to eights. All right. And then the assignment, like I said before,</p>
                        <p><strong>[07:59,000]</strong> is I want the Logisim file that has both the adder circuits and the decoder circuit</p>
                        <p><strong>[08:04,000]</strong> and the answer to the extension question. How do you go from a three to eight to a four</p>
                        <p><strong>[08:09,000]</strong> to sixteen? Okay. So that is week three. If you have any questions, please post them on</p>
                        <p><strong>[08:14,000]</strong> the discussion board. I will be monitoring that. And I hope you have some fun with this.</p>
                        <p><strong>[08:18,000]</strong> I think Logisim is a great tool. I think it's a lot of fun to build these circuits</p>
                        <p><strong>[08:22,000]</strong> and see them work. And so I hope you enjoy it. All right. Aloha.</p>
